This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

Edijs comments - some things that work but weirdly:
When login is pressed all the components are shown but main page is still showing login somehow, but all the routes for navigation with sidebar works properly. 
You cant go back to login when you are logged in but when logout is pressed then nothing seems to happen but route is changed because then if project is reloaded the app goes to login screen. 
All the tasks should be done or atleast something, I know you are going through everything just wanted to add this just incase. 
About me has functionality but it reads data from hard coded stuff in same file didnt manage to change it.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
